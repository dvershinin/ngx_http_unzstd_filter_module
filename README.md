# Name
ngx_http_unzstd_filter_module is a filter that decompresses responses with “Content-Encoding: zstd” for clients that do not support “zstd” ([Zstandard compression](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/)) encoding method. The module will be useful when it is desirable to store data compressed to save space and reduce I/O costs.

# Status

Actively maintained by [GetPageSpeed](https://www.getpagespeed.com/). This
repository continues [the original module by Hanada](https://github.com/HanadaLee/ngx_http_unzstd_filter_module) with hardened response
processing, deterministic cleanup, standalone zstd dependency detection, and a
real NGINX regression suite. The suite specifically guards the historical
double chunked-end-marker failure, fragmented upstream chunks, concatenated
frames, corrupt and truncated input, dictionary handling, reloads, hostile
clients, and worker replacement.

Prebuilt packages for RHEL, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Amazon Linux, Fedora,
Debian, Ubuntu, SLES, and Plesk are available as `nginx-module-unzstd` from
[GetPageSpeed extras](https://nginx-extras.getpagespeed.com/modules/unzstd/).

# Synopsis

```nginx
server {
    listen 127.0.0.1:8080;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        # enable zstd decompression for clients that do not support zstd compression
        unzstd on;

        proxy_pass http://foo.com;
    }
}
```

# Installation

To use theses modules, configure your nginx branch with `--add-module=/path/to/ngx_http_unzstd_filter_module`. Several points should be taken care.

* Zstandard 1.4.0 or later is required.
* You can set environment variables `ZSTD_INC` and `ZSTD_LIB` to specify the path to `zstd.h` and the path to the zstd library respectively.
* A shared library is used when present; otherwise, the static library is used. Static linking is recommended because this Nginx module uses **advanced APIs**.
* System's zstd bundle will be linked if `ZSTD_INC` and `ZSTD_LIB` are not specified.

# Directives

## unzstd

**Syntax:** *unzstd on | off;*

**Default:** *unzstd off;*

**Context:** *http, server, location, when*

Enables or disables decompression of zstd compressed responses for clients that lack zstd support.
When built with `ngx_condition_module`, this directive can also be configured
inside a `when` block.

## unzstd_force

**Syntax:** *unzstd_force on | off;*

**Default:** *unzstd_force off;*

**Context:** *http, server, location, when*

When enabled, decompresses zstd responses without checking whether the client
accepts zstd. Responses without `Content-Encoding: zstd` are not affected.
When built with `ngx_condition_module`, this directive can also be configured
inside a `when` block.

## unzstd_buffers

**Syntax:** *unzstd_buffers number size;*

**Default:** *unzstd_buffers 32 4k | 16 8k;*

**Context:** *http, server, location*

Sets the number and size of buffers used to decompress a response. By default, the buffer size is equal to one memory page. This is either 4K or 8K, depending on a platform.

This module is based on [ngx_http_gunzip_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gunzip_module.html), one of nginx core modules and [ngx_unbrotli](https://github.com/clyfish/ngx_unbrotli), a nginx module for brotli decompression.

# Testing

The fast suite builds a real dynamic module and runs it with nginx.org's
official `nginx-tests` harness:

```bash
make tests
```

The release gate also includes static ASan/UBSan execution, exhaustive
cppcheck, CodeQL, renamed-module loading, `nginx -t` and `nginx -T`, hostile
client probes, reload and worker-replacement checks, settled file-descriptor
accounting, and schema-v1 Torture Lab evidence:

```bash
make lint
make tests-asan
make runtime
```
